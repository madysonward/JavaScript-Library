//Notes and Code: A Guide for All to Come
//***************************************************************************************

/* 
Welcome to JavaScript! The lessons ahead will have both notes and code. Notes can be
added like the above (lines 3, 4, and 5) for single-lined notes, with two forward slashes, or 
like this current note (lines 6-) for multiple-lined notes, beginning with a forward 
slash and an asterisk sign AND ending with an asterisk sign and forward slash. (Note the order!)

As a guide, I will have different note styles for different situations:
   1) Three single-lined notes in a row (two full lines of dashes & a topic title in the middle)
   2) Multiple-lined notes (for the notes bulk!)
   3) One single-lined note (full of dashes - for sectioning off notes/code)
   3) Single-lined notes (for commenting out code that isn't meant to function with the other code
 currently written on the page, or that is just an example)
