//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* The Object.keys() method returns an array to represent all own enumerable properties of a given object. 
This occurs in the same order that a for...in loops would give. It is coded like this: */

Object.keys(obj);

/* NOTE: obj acts as a parameter, and is defined as the object of which the enumerable own properties are 
to be returned.

Object.keys() returns an array of which the elements are strings corresponding the enumerable properties 
found directly upon Object. */
